                    This is a simple utility for music producers to find samples using YouTube's vast library of videos.
                    Since its creation the tool has been featured on some of the most popular sampling/music websites&colon;

                    I'm a huge fan of
                    <a href="https&colon;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9WMNuyjm4w">Luke Mascat's talk</a>
                    about a tabletop strategy game that was banned from his workplace.
                    Not having a way to play this game myself, I decided to remake it, doing a small design deep dive
                    on Discord bots as a medium for multiplayer games.

                <p>
                    RhythmHQ was a project stemming from the idea of
                    <a href="">Pirate Radio Stations</a>
                    but with a focus on underground artists from different parts of the world. This was
                    also around the time I discovered serverless architecture and thought it would be
                    a fun way to learn more.

                    I've written many site generators in the past. This is just another in the long bloodline of <em>House Static Site Generator</em>.

            <p>
                I've loved writing compilers, interpreters, and the like for as long as I can remember. SB2 was to learn more about
                how stack machines work and also because I wanted to make an assembly-like language. I chose <span class="crystal"></span> since it's
                designed to be a lower-level version of <span class="ruby"></span> and that's an interesting idea to me.
